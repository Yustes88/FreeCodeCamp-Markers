# FreeCodeCamp-Markers
My second simple project from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design)

## While completing this project,  I tried to improve the following skills:
- creating a new git repository and cloning it to my desktop with shh key
- working with git
- HTML markup 
- CSS color style

## Main issues
- Every time I face a problem to center an element
- Git: not creating a branch and pushing changes to a wrong branch
- Color matching
